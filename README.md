# Hardware Acceleration checker.

A small utility to check if hardware acceleration is causing CS2 to freeze for a while after alt-tabbing

This app checks for the hardware acceleration flag in Brave, Chrome, Steam, Mozzila, Spotify.

Make sure to run it as admin otherwise it won't work

Thank you and good luck.
